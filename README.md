For verification of correct transaction handling I created unittests that in descriptive way show the scenarios that came to my mind.

I have put all the classes into one script to avoid any importing issues. Otherwise, I would move classes to appropriate modules like `_inputs.py`, `_outputs.py`, `_transactions.py` and so on.
